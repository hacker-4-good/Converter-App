This is a Streamlit app that converts SGPA, CGPA and Percentage.

To use the app, open the `converter.py` file in a code editor. Then, run the following command in the terminal:

```
streamlit run converter.py
```

The app will open in a new browser window. You can then select the option you want to convert from the dropdown menu. For example, if you want to convert SGPA to CGPA, select the "SGPA" option and enter the SGPA value. Then, click the "Submit" button. The app will calculate the CGPA value and display it on the screen.

Here are some additional details about the code:

* The `st.title()` function is used to display the title of the app.
* The `st.subheader()` function is used to display the subheader of the app.
* The `st.selectbox()` function is used to create a dropdown menu.
* The `st.number_input()` function is used to create a number input field.
* The `st.button()` function is used to create a button.
* The `st.text()` function is used to display text on the screen.

I hope this helps!
